# Infinite-Room-Unity
A unity implementation of the non-euclidean rotating room.
I was inspired by this here https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/gcnncg/the_main_menu_cinematic_for_my_new_game_combining/.
And credit to here https://forum.unity.com/threads/scissor-rectangle.37612/ for the camera scissoring script.
The irony is that the scissoring script is the only interesting bit of code, oh well.
